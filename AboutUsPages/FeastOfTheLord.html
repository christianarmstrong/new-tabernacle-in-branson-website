                Today many Christians are seeking the biblical Jewish roots of their faith in Yeshua(Hebrew for Jesus). One of the primary ways in which Yeshua is revealed in the Old Covenant(Hebrew "Tanach") Scriptures is through the Biblical Feasts of the Lord listed in Leviticus 23. These feasts and appointed times, called "moedim" in Hebrew, include:

                <b>Seven Major Annual Festivals</b>
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                There are seven major annual festivals in all; three are celebrated in the early spring, one in the late spring, and three in the fall. As you examine the significance of each feast, you will see that they spell out God's "timeline" for the history of the world and for the salvation of all mankind. The first four festivals have already been totally completed in the first coming of the Messiah Jesus. The last three, which are the fall festivals, have partially been completed in the first coming of Yeshua, and will be totally completed in His second coming.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                The early spring festivals of Passover, Unleavened Bread, and First Fruits are celebrated in the first month of the year(Nisan, according to the Hebrew Calendar). They speak of the "blood of the lamb" shed for our sins by Yeshua, who became the "bread of affliction" for us )though He was sinless and without leaven), who also rose from the dead as the "first fruits from the ground" on the day after the Sabbath during the week of Passover. Scripture references for these three feasts are in Leviticus 23:5-12
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                The late spring festival is called the Feast of Weeks (Shavuot in Hebrew). It is observed 50 days after Passover and First Fruits in the third month of the year (Sivan in Hebrew). It points toward the unity of all believers (Jew or Gentile) represented by the two loaves of "leavened bread" waved before the Lord on this day, and toward the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost, the same day the Feast of Weeks was being celebrated in Jerusalem. Scripture references for this feast are Leviticus 23:15-17 and Acts 2
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                The fall festivals of the Feast of trumpets (Rosh Hashanah), the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) and the Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot) are celebrated in the seventh month of the year (the Hebrew month of Tishrei).
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                The Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) points toward Yeshua as our Great High Priest, and the "once and for all" blood atonement that He shed for all sinners. It also speaks of a future "national day of atonement" in the land of Israel, when they look upon Yeshua and weep for Him as a firstborn son" (according to Zechariah 12:10)
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                The Feast of Tabernacles points toward the birth of Yeshua in His first coming, but also the millenial reign of Yeshua after His second coming. After the national repentence of Israel (Zechariah 12) and after the battle of Armageddon (Zechariah 14), all the nations will go up year after year to worship the Lord during the Feast of Tabernacles. Other Scripture references for feasts are Leviticus 23:23-44, I Thessalonians 4:16, 17, and Zechariah 14:16
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                All seven of these biblical feasts of the Lord are centered around Jesus, our King, Messiah, and Great High Priest, and all of them are for all of Gods people, Jew and Gentile alike.

                The Sabbath Day in Hebrew is called "Shabbat". Shabbat is a primary Hebrew root word which has many meanings. It means "to cease from exertion, to rest, to put away, to rid yourself of." But it also means "to celebrate" (as in celebrating the benefits of entering that rest).
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                In Genesis 2:2-3 we see that God created the Sabbath day in the very beginning, long before the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob were born. God created Shabbat for all mankind, long before the 10 commandments and the Torah were given to Moses and the children of Israel.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                God created Shabbat, sanctified it and blessed it, and set it apart as a special holy day for His creation to "rest and to be in "fellowship" with Him.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                Yeshua(Jesus) the Messiah Himself re-affirmed this in Mark 2:27 when he said "The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath". He said this because the Pharisees(like many Talmudic Rabbis today were imposing many man-made traditions upon the people in regards to Shabbat, making it a hardship to keep the Sabbath: when all along, God created the Sabbath to be a blessing for mankind and that they should "delight in the Sabbath" (According to Isaiah 58:13-14).
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                In Genesis 2:2-3 we also see that Shabbat is definitely the 7th day of the week. It reads in Hebrew, "Yom hash-vee-ee" which means the 7th day. That means from Friday evening at sundown to Saturday evening at sundown, not only according to the Hebrew calendar, but according to the Bible as well. Therefore Shabbat should not be "watered down" to any other day of the week, not even Sunday (don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that you shouldn't go to church on Sunday - God should be worshipped every day of the week.) But don't call Sunday the Sabbath Day, because it is not!

            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                In Exodus 20:8-11 we see that observing the Sabbath day is one of the 10 commandments. God gave the Sabbath to the Israelites, but He also gave Shabbat to any "strangers," who were living amongst or who had "joined" themselves to the Israelites (Exodus 20:10). The word stranger reads in Hebrew, "geyr" which means a foreigner, an alien, a stranger, a non-Israelite or one who is from the nations - in other words, a Gentile! Even in the 10 commandments in the the Torah itself, God clearly states that Shabbat is for Jews and Gentiles alike

                As you further examine the Scriptures you will see that God gave all the biblical feasts to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles as well. This would include the Feast of Passover, Unleavened Bread in the early spring, all the way through the Feast of Tabernacles in the fall according to Exodus 12:19 and Deuteronomy 16:9-14
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                According to Leviticus 23:1-3 Shabbat is definitely a feast of the Lord, a feast that we get to celebrate not just once a year like the other biblical feasts, but a feast that we get to celebrate once a week, every week of the year. At the end of a long "work week", what a blessing it is to be able to "throw your hands up in the air and say "Thank God, it's Shabbat!"

                Leviticus 23:3 also calls Shabbat a "holy convocation", a "sacred assembly", "indicating that the Israelites and the Gentiles who had "joined themselves" to the Jewish people "gathered together" on Shabbat to worship the Lord. The writer of Hebrews adds to this in Hebrews 10:25 that we, as believers in Yeshua(Jesus) "should not forsake the gathering of the assembly"

                Now Yeshua of course was Jewish. He was circumcised on the 8th day (Luke2:21) which was the seal of God's covenant with Abraham. He was dedicated, officially named at the Temple on the 8th day (Luke 2:21), which was the custom of the Jewish people. He fulfilled his "rite of passage" (which was a former name for "Bar Mitzvah") (Luke 2:46-47), and according to Luke 4:16, Yeshua attended Shabbat services on a regular basis - HE STILL DOES! Yeshua (Jesus) was a Torah observant Jew.

            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                Yeshua never did away with Sabbath - remember, He said in Matthew 5:17&18 "Do not think i've come to abolish the Law or the prophets, I've come to fulfill them. Until haven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, nor the least stroke of a pen will disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished".

                Not only did Jesus honor and keep the Sabbath - He himself created it! In the gospel of John, chapter 1:1-3 it say "In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God, and the Word was God-all things that were made were made through Him. It goes on to say in verse 14 - "and the Word became flesh and dwelt among us."

                Shabbat is also the sign and the seal of the Mosaic Covenant(Ex 31:12-17), and again, Yeshua observed, taught and upheld the Torah of Moses, and taught others to do the same.(Matthew 5:17-19)

                The biblical account of the millennial reign of Yeshua is found in Zechariah 14 and Revelation 20. The Scriptures say that Yeshua will rule and reign in Jerusalem for a 1000 years and again, there will be peace and "rest" throughout the whole earth. This is all connected with the beginning of the "eternal Shabbat" that God has prepared for His people since the beginning of time.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                What's even of further interest to all of us is that the millennial reign of Yeshua is connected with the Feast of Tabernacles, which just happens to be the 7th annual feast of the Lord, celebrated for 7 days in the 7th month of the year (Leviticus 23:34)

                Somehow, through all of this, every believer, whether Jew or Gentile, has got to understand that God created the Sabbath not just for the Jewish people, but for the Gentiles as well, pointing towards a time of eternal peace and "rest" in the earth, when we will all be worshipping Yeshua, the King of all Kings together in Jerusalem.

                This to me is one of the most profound meanings of Shabbat. It goes beyond any day of the week, or any place in the earth. It is not in any man-made church building or synagogue. It's a place in the "spirit realm." In the Holy of Holies in a tabernacle pitched not by man, but by the Lord Himself, it's within the veil of the Heavenly Sanctuary and the only way you can enter that "Sabbath rest" is through the shed blood of Yeshua Ha Mashiach, Jesus the Messiah. It is a place where you can come before a merciful and compassionate Great High Priest and cry out "Lord, help me, Lord heal me, Lord save me, Lord deliver me, Lord have mercy on me!"

                It's also a place where you can "worship in Spirit and in truth", where you can stand before the Throne of the Almighty, the One who was, the One who is, and the One who is to come.". It's a place where you can cry out with all the heavenly beings, "Glory, honor, power, praise, riches, strength, wisdom, and blessings, belong to the Lamb who sites upon the Throne forever and ever!

            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                As a Messianic Rabbi, I am often asked: "If God created Shabbat to be the 7th day of the week as a day of rest in Him, why is it that most believers in Jesus worship on Sunday, which is the first day of the week?"
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                Well, first of all, let me say that God should be worshiped every day of the week. However, we should note that Friday evening through Saturday evening (the 7th day) is the official day of worship, rest and fellowship with the Lord, according to the Scriptures in Genesis 2:2-3, Exodus 20:8-11, Exodus 31:12-17 and Leviticus 23:1-3, just to name a few.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                In addition, it was the regular custom of Yeshua (Jesus) and the apostle Paul to attend synagogue services on the Sabbath Day (Luke 4:16 and Acts 13:14-16). As a matter of fact, the entire body of the early Messianic Believers in Jesus, both Jew and Gentile, worshipped on Shabbat, the 7th day of the week, honoring the Sabbath Day as was commanded by God for the Jewish people and any Gentiles living amongst them (Exodus 20:10), also conforming to Isaiah 56:6 which says, "Let the sons of the foreigners who join themselves to the Lord keep my covenant and honor the Sabbath." This Scripture points toward Romans 11 which says that Gentiles are grafted into the House of Israel and Ephesians 2 which says that Gentiles are now part of the commonwealth of Israel.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                However, in the early centuries after the death and resurrection of Yeshua, things began to change. After the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem by the Romans in 70 A.D., most of the Jewish believers fled from the city, many others scattered over the earth. The Messianic Jewish influence over the Gentile Christians was for the most part, gone!

            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                Then came the de-Judiazation process, by the early Roman emperors and Roman Church fathers, which was rooted in the demonic spirit of anti-Semitism, saying that the Christian Church has "replaced the Jews" as the true Israel of God, that true Christians should have nothing to do with those Jewish people nor their practices, because they "murdered our Lord".

            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">

                At the council of Nicea in 325 A.D, the Roman Emperor Constantine took it a step further changing Passover into something called Easter, which finds its roots in paganism. By the late 4th century, further legislation forbid Christians from observing the Sabbath, from keeping the Jewish Passover, and from observing any of the laws of Moses (God's Torah). Even though Jesus said in Matthew 5:17 "do not think I've come to abolish the law, I've come to fulfill it." Even though Paul warned the church in Rome in Romans 11:18 "remember, you don't support the root.... the root supports you!"

The repented cross thief said to the other cross thief  (Luke 23:41), "We deserve the punishment we are getting, but this man has done nothing wrong."

                Exodus 12:46 says that not a bone of the Passover Lamb was to be broken. The legs of the two cross thieves were broken, but not Yeshua's, thus fulfilling the Scripture. In every way, Yeshua fulfilled all the requirements of the Torah, even to the smallest detail, to be the Passover Lamb of God. He is the Torah of God made flesh in the person of Jesus of Nazareth, the Spoken Word, which became the Written Word, which became the Living Word!

                Another biblical feast, very closely associated with Passover, is the Feast of Unleavened Bread, pronounced in Hebrew, "Chag Ha Matzot." This feast also points directly to Jesus, as do all of the Feasts of the Lord. Passover, as we've seen, is observed on the 14th day of the Hebrew month of Nisan, according to Leviticus 23:5, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread is observed for seven more days, from the 15th through the 21st of Nisan, according to Leviticus 23:6. During the entire eight day period only bread without "leaven" could be eaten.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                "Leaven" in the Bible is symbolic of sin. In the Hebrew language leaven is referred to as "chametz," which means "something that ferments and leads to bitterness in the end. "Sin in our lives will continue to ferment and lead to bitterness in the end, for "the wages of sin is death"(Romans 6:23)
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                Of course, Yeshua was without sin, and right away we can see how the Feast of Unleavened Bread points toward Him, especially as it is directly connected with the Feast of Passover, which points toward the blood of Yeshua that was shed for all sinners. Another way of putting that is He, even though He was sinless, became "the bread of affliction" for all of us!

                During Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread we eat unleavened bread, which, in Judaism, is commonly called Matzah. If you look closely at a piece of Matzah you will see that it is "striped, pierced, and bruised," a picture of God's suffering Messiah in Isaiah 53 who was "pierced for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities and by whose stripes we are healed!"
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                Another Jewish tradition, based on Exodus 12:18-20, is removing all the leaven from Jewish homes shortly before Passover. This ceremony is called in Hebrew "Bedikat Chametz" which means "removing the leaven."
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                Isn't it interesting that just before Passover, Jesus entered the temple in Jerusalem and overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold doves (Matthew 21:12). What was He doing? He was cleansing His Father's house from all leaven, just before Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                There is a very interesting Scripture found in Exodus 12:19. "For seven days, no leaven is to be found in your houses, since whoever eats what is leavened. That person shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is a stranger or a native of the land. "The word "stranger" reads in Hebrew "geyr." one who is a foreigner, an alien, one who is from the nations, a Gentile.

            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left  w3-margin-right" style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                God commanded for future generations that any Gentiles living amongst the Israelites should celebrate the Feast of Passover and Unleavened Bread with the Jewish people, a picture of unity in the Messiah.

                According to Lev. 23:9-12, on the day after the Sabbath during the week of Passover, a sheaf of the first fruits from the ground was to be waved before the Lord as an acceptable sacrifice. It was accomplished by a burnt offering of a male lamb of the first year without a blemish

            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                This clearly points toward the resurrection of Yeshua who arose from the dead on the day after the Sabbath during the week of Passover being the "first fruits from the ground" according to 1st Cor. 15:20

                These are the early spring biblical feasts of the Lord (Leviticus 23:4-12); the Feast of Passover, Unleavened Bread and First Fruits, and they pointed toward the crucifixion and resurrection of Yeshua Ha Mashiach, Jesus the Messiah.

                The next feast on the calendar is the Feast of Weeks (Shavuot) which is celebrated in the late spring and it too points toward Yeshua and towards the unity of all believers (Jew or Gentile) in the Messiah.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                In Leviticus 23:17 God instructed the Israelites to present to Him a wave offering of two loaves of bread made with "leaven.. The two loaves were symbolic of Israel and the nations, or in other words, Jew or Gentile, who are all one in the Messiah. Leaven, of course, represents sin in the Bible, and "all have sinned (whether Jew or Gentile) and come short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23)

            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                It is very interesting that during the early spring festivals of Passover, Unleavened Bread, and First Fruits, only "unleavened" bread could be used, because those three feast pointed directly to Yeshua, who was sinless.

                The Feast of Weeks (Shavuot) is a picture of unity between Jew and Gentile in the Messiah. This picture of unity is beautifully illustrated for us in the story of Ruth and Boaz. The book of Ruth traditionally is read on Shavuot because the setting of the story takes place during the Feast of Weeks itself in the late spring harvest
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                Ruth faithfully followed her Jewish mother-in-law, Naomi, to Bethlehem saying, "Wherever you go, I will go. Your God shall be my God, and your people my people."

            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                Soon after arriving in Bethlehem Ruth began to glean in the fields of Boaz, a biblical right that she had, even as a Gentile, according to God's Torah in Leviticus 23:22. As the story continues, Ruth and Boaz fall in love and Boaz takes Ruth to be his wife. Eventually they had a son whom they named Obed. Obed became the father of Jesse, and Jesse became the father of King David. David was from the tribe of Judah, and through his lineage came Yeshua (Jesus) who is the Lion of the tribe of Judah. What a beautiful story of unity between Boaz, a Jewish man, and Ruth, a Gentile woman, and how through their lineage came the Messiah, and in Him we are all one.

            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                God richly blessed Ruth because she had a heart for the God of Israel, and for the Jewish people. Many Christians today have this heart of Ruth and God is blessing them as well. Indeed, the Scripture rings true from Genesis 12:3 when God said to Abraham "I will bless those who bless you and curse those who curse you." God wants to bless you today as you embrace the biblical Jewish roots of your faith in Yeshua, the Jewish Messiah and Savior of the world.

                The Feast of Weeks is definitely an agricultural festival pointing toward unity in the Messiah - but the feast has a second major theme to it as it also commemorates the giving of the Law (God's Torah) to Moses and the children of Israel at Mt. Sinai.

                Fifty days after the Israelites came out of Egypt, which took place during Passover; they came to Mt. Sinai and received the Torah.

                Fifty days after Yeshua became our Passover Lamb, came the outpouring of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2), fulfilling the words of the prophet Jeremiah in chapter 31, when God said, "Behold the days are coming when I will make a new covenant with the House of Israel and Judah. I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts and they will all know me from the least to the greatest (Jeremiah 31:31-34)

                So far, we have taken a closer look at the first four of these festivals, Passover, Unleavened Bread, First Fruits, and the Feast of Weeks, which are celebrated in the early and late spring. They clearly point toward the crucifixion and resurrection of the Messiah, and the outpouring of the Ruach Ha Kodesh (the Holy Spirit). Therefore, these four festivals have been fulfilled completely completely in the first coming of the Messiah Jesus.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                Now we'll move on to the fall festivals, which have partially been completed in Yeshua's first coming, but will totally be completed in the second coming of the Messiah.

            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                The three festivals are the Feast of Trumpets (Yom Teruah and Rosh Hashanah in Hebrew), the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), and the Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot in Hebrew). All three of these feasts are observed during the month of Tishrei, the seventh month of the Hebrew calendar.

                For this reason it is associated with the second appearance of the Messiah and the rapture of the body of believers, conforming to the words of Paul in First Timothy 4:16-17, "For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an arch-angel, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Messiah will rise first. Then we, who are alive and remain, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will be with the Lord forever."

                The Feast of Trumpets is also associated with a Day of Judgment ("Yom Ha Din" in Hebrew). A day when books are opened and final judgment takes place. According to Daniel 7:9-10, "The Ancient of Days was seated, ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him, the court was seated and the books were opened." Daniel goes on to say in verses 13 & 14, in connection with verses 9 & 10: "And behold, One like the Son of Man, coming with the clouds of heaven... and to Him was given dominion and glory and a Kingdom, that all peoples, nations and languages should serve Him, and His dominion will never pass away."

                Further connections are made by the words of the Messiah, Himself, in Matthew 24:30, 31. Jesus said, "Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory, and He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other."

                On Rosh Hashanah God is recognized as the Divine creator and as King of the universe.

One of the reasons we sound the shofar (the rams horn) on Rosh Hashanah is to "hail the King" with the blast of the horn.

                This season of T'shuva begins 30 days before Rosh Hashanah on the first day of the Hebrew month of Elul. During the month of Elul the shofar is sounded every morning to remind the Jewish people to "search their soul" and "repent of all sins" before the high holy days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur arrive. These are observed on the first and the tenth day of the month of Tishrei, the Hebrew month that follows the month of Elul.

                During the 40-day period, the story of Abraham and Issac on Mt. Moriah (Genesis 22) is read in Jewish synagogues and in Jewish houses. In Hebrew, it is called "the Akidah" which means "the binding of Isaac". The story itself is a reminder to our Jewish people that God provided a sacrifice in place of Issac, a ram caught by its "horns" in the bushes. Here we see another connection with the ram's horn (the shofar), and the biblical Jewish feasts of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. But the greater significance is that God provided a "lamb" in place of Isaac, as Abraham prophesied that He would in Genesis 22:8

Moriah became the very place where King Solomon built the temple 1,000 years later, and the very place where Yeshua (Jesus) was sacrificed for our sins 2,000 years later as "the precious Lamb of God". This was the real fulfillment of Abraham's prophecy.

Then the High Priest offered the blood of a goat for the sins of the rest of the Israelites. It was the blood of these animals that made "atonement" for the Israelites, thus fulfilling the Scriptures in Leviticus 17:11 and Hebrews 9:22 that says, "It is the blood that makes atonement for the soul," and "without this shedding of blood there is no remission of sin."

                Yom Kippur is called the "Day of Atonement" in English, but the Hebrew word "Kippur" came from the word "Kipporah", which means "covering" or in its deepest translation, means "a ransom by means of a substitute."

            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                The shedding of blood as a "Kapporah" (an "atonement" or "covering for sin") goes way back in the Bible, even back to the Garden of Eden.

                After sinning against God, by eating the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Adam and Eve, realizing their nakedness, made their own "covering" for their sins by sewing "fig leaves" together as a "covering for themselves". But God didn't accept their covering, their own idea of "atonement," so He made garments of skin for Adamn and Eve. The skin of these kosher animals required the "shedding of blood", and without the "shedding of blood" there is no forgiveness of sin. For the first time in history, blood was shed to "cover the sin" of man.

            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                People today (like Adam and Eve) still come up with their own idea of a "covering" or "atonement" for their sins, such as "I'm a nice person and I never hurt anyone". "Surely God won't send me to Hell." Some people think, "If I just give enough to charity, I'll go to heaven." Some of our Jewish people cast "stones" or "pieces of bread" which represent their sins, into a body of water (called Tashlich in Hebrew) thinking that God will forgive their sins this way. Some, in Orthodox Judaism, swing a dead chicken over their heads on Yom Kippur (called "Kaparot" in Hebrew) saying "this is the atonement for my sins." Some believe that "just because I'm Jewish" I'm going to go to heaven". Well, I'm Jewish also, but let me tell you something..."

                Unless you receive the "blood atonement" that was shed for you by Yeshua the Messiah on the "tree of sacrifice," you're not going to make it into heaven - whether Jew or Gentile, because God says in the Torah (First Covenant) and in the New Covenant Scriptures "without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sin". Yeshua the Messiah clearly said, "I am the Way the Truth and the Light, no man comes to the Father but by Me!" Whether you are Jewish or Gentile, don't rely on the "traditions of men" for your salvation, but on the word of God which endures forever!

                In taking a closer look at the ministry of Aaron, the High Priest, on Yom Kippur, he did the following according to Leviticus 16:

            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                He entered the "mikvah" (the bronze laver filled with water in the outer court of the Tabernacle of Moses) and washed his entire body. He then put on special holy garments, presented special incense before the Lord and sprinkled the blood of a young bull on the "mercy seat" in the Holy of Holies as "atonement" for his own sins and the sins of his family.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                Aaron also presented two male goats before the Lord. Lots were cast for the two goats. One goat was sacrificed for the sins of the people and the blood of that goat was sprinkled on the "mercy seat" and on the horns of the altar, along with the blood of the bull. However, the other goat(called the "scapegoat") was released into the wilderness. One goat represented God's judgment, the other God's mercy.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                Later on in Temple history a certain ritual was added to all of this, using three scarlet woolen ropes. One scarlet rope was tied to the horns of the scapegoat and one hung from the front of the temple. After all the Yom Kippur sacrifices were completed by the High Priest a mighty miracle took place. The scarlet rope hanging from the temple supernaturally turned "white". This was God's sign to the Israelites that their sins were forgiven, conforming to Isaiah 1:18, "though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow".
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                However, immediately after the crucificion of Yeshua (Jesus) and for the next 40 years until the Temple was destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D., the scarlet cord never turned "white" again. This, too, was God's answer to the Israelites - that there was no need for that to happen any longer because the sacrifice of Yeshua, the "blood of atonement" that He shed on the tree of sacrifice, put an end to the Mosaic sacrificial system.

                In addition, just as Aaron offered special incense before the Lord, Yeshua offered Himself as a "sweet fragrance to God"(Ephesians 5:2). As High Priest, Aaron made intercession for the people in the Holy of Holies on Yom Kippur, pointing toward Yeshua, our Great High Priest, who is always interceding for us at the right hand of God.

                On Yom Kippur, Aaron appeared before the glory of God, which dwelt between the cherubim above a "horizontal mercy seat" in the Holy of Holies. According to John 20:12, two angels stood where the body of Yeshua had laid horizontally in the tomb, one at His head and One at His feet, with the glory of God in between them, a picture of God's "mercy" through the death of His Son. For one brief moment that tomb became the Holy of Holies for all of us!

Zechariah 13:1 goes on to say, "In that day, a fountain shall be opened for the House of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sins and for uncleanness". This is clearly a picture of a national "Day of Atonement" for Israel in the future. It is connected with the return of the Messiah, for the prophet Zechariah goes on to say in chapter 14:2-9, "For in that day, I will gather all the nations to battle against Jerusalem.... then the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations as He fights in the day of battle - and in that day it shall be, the Lord is One and His Name One"!

                In Leviticus 23:34-44, God told the Israelites to dwell in "booths" for 7 days and to rejoice before Him, after bringing in their fall harvest which He had abundantly supplied. The word "booth" is pronounced "sukkah" in Hebrew, and from the plural "Sukkot" we get the Hebrew name for the Feast of Tabernacles.

            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                Because the Feast of Sukkot was basically an agricultural festival, God commanded the Israelites in Leviticus 23:40 "to take the fruit of beautiful trees, branches of palm trees, the boughs of leafy trees and willows of the brook..." The fruit of the beautiful trees is a sweet smelling "citrus" fruit called an Etrog Hebrew. The branches of the trees are referred to in Hebrew as the "lulav". On the lulav and the etrog" were waved before the Lord in every direction, acknowledging God's Omni-presence throughout the heavens and the earth and to thank him, through a "wave offering", for providing an abundant harvest. This was similar to the "waving of 2 loaves of leavened bread" (Leviticus 23:17) during Shavuot, the Feast of Weeks, another agricultural festival celebrated the late spring.

                According to rabbinic Judaism, the lulav and the etrog have different symbolic meanings, but to us as believers in Yeshua, we understand that it points toward Israel and the nations - Jew and Gentiles, who are all one in the Messiah, just like the two loaves of bread did as they were waved before the Lord during Shavuot. Deuteronomy 16:14 adds further insight to all of this, where God commands any Gentiles living amongst the Israelites to rejoice before the Lord with them, and to celebrate the Feast of Sukkot together.

                The word "Sukkot" is the plural for the Hebrew word "Sukkah" which means a booth, or a tabernacle. In Leviticus 23:41-43, God commanded the Israelites to live in booths for seven days after gathering in the fall harvest, and to rejoice before Him.

                A booth (Sukkah) is a temporary dwelling place (flimsily made by intention). It is a temporary shelter, or a temporary provision. When God commanded the Israelites to dwell in booths (Sukkot), He was emphasizing to them and the generation that followed that their dependence was on Him, and not on a man-made structure.

Our dependence should not be upon our flesh, nor upon anything materialistic, but upon God.

                Sukkot is one of the most joyful feasts of the Lord celebrated for seven days from the 15th through the 21st of the month of Tishrei, which is the seventh month of the year according to the Hebrew calendar.

                The Feast of Tabernacles has different names and themes given to it. It is called in Hebrew "Chag Ha-asif," (the Feast of Ingathering) because it celebrated the "ingathering" of the fall harvest. It is called "Z'man Simchateynu," (the Season of our Rejoicing). It is called the "Feast of Dedication" because it was during the Feast of Tabernacles that the Temple of Solomon was dedicated (II Chronicles 7). It is called the "Festival of Lights" ("Chag Ha Orim" in Hebrew) because of the "glory" of God that filled the Temple of Solomon.

            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                It is also called "Chag Ha Goyim" (the Feast of the Nations). This is very interesting because once again we see that the biblical Jewish feasts of the Lord are not just for the Israelites, but for all the nations. In Deuteronomy 16:11-16, God commanded any "strangers" living amongst the Israelites to celebrate Sukkot(The Feast of Tabernacles) with them. The word for "stranger" reads in Hebrew "geyr", which can also mean a foreigner, an alien, a non-Israelite or a Gentile. For the word "geyr" we get the plural word "Goyim", which means "the nations." Not only does God want Gentile believers in Jesus to celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles with Jewish believers after the second coming of the Messiah and the battle of Armageddon, it shall come to pass that they shall worship the Lord of Hosts, and keep the Feast of Tabernacles.

                The story of Purim is told in the Biblical book of Esther. The heroes of the story are Esther, a beautiful young Jewish woman living in Persia, and her cousin Mordecai, who raised her as if she were his daughter. Esther was taken to the house of Ahasuerus, King of Persia, to become part of his harem. King Ahasuerus loved Esther more than his other women and made Esther queen, but the king did not know that Esther was a Jew, because Mordecai told her not to reveal her identity.

                The villain of the story is Haman, an arrogant, egotistical advisor to the king. Haman hated Mordecai because Mordecai refused to bow down to Haman, so Haman plotted to destroy the Jewish people. In a speech that is all too familiar to Jews, Haman told the king, "There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your realm. Their laws are different from those of every other people's, and they do not observe the king's laws; therefore it is not benefitting the king to tolerate them." (Esther 3:8). The king gave the fate of the Jewish people to Haman, to do as he pleased to them. Haman planned to exterminate all of the Jews.

            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                Mordecai persuaded Esther to speak to the king on behalf of the Jewish people. This was a dangerous thing for Esther to do, because anyone who came into the king's presence without being summoned could be put to death, and she had not been summoned. Esther fasted for three days to prepare herself, then went into the king. He welcomed her. Later, she told him of Haman's plot against her people. The Jewish people were saved, and Haman was hanged on the gallows that had been prepared for Mordecai.

                The book of Esther is unusual in that it is the only book of the Bible that does not contain the name of God. In fact, it includes virtually no reference to God. Mordecai makes a vague reference to the fact that the Jews will be saved by someone else, if not by Esther, but that is the closest the book comes to mentioning God. Thus one important message that can be gained from the story is that God often works in ways that are not apparent.

                Purim is celebrated on the 14th day of Adar, which is usually in March. The 13th of Adar is the day that Haman chose for the extermination of the Jews, and the day that the Jews battled their enemies for their lives. On the day afterwards, the 14th, they celebrated their survival. In cities that were walled in the time of Joshua, Purim is celebrated on the 15th of the month, because the book of Esther says that in Shushan (a walled city), deliverance from the massacre was not complete until the next day. The 15th is referred to as Shushan Purim.

                The primary commandment related to Purim is to hear the reading of the book of Esther. The book of Esther is commonly known as the Megillah, which means scroll. It is customary to boo, hiss, stamp feet and rattle groggers (noisemakers) whenever the name of Haman is mentioned in the service. The purpose of this custom is to "blot out the name of Haman."

                While we all enjoy the hilarious fun of Purim, we would be remiss if we did not remember the severity of the potential consequences of the Jewish people then and now. Anti-Semitism is alive and well today. Believers today are modern day Esthers and are here "for such a time as this". We are to stand in the gap and pray continually for the Jewish people, that the Haman's of today would be wiped out - just as surely as in Persia. We must also remember that it was the apathy of Ahasuerus that ultimately paved the way for the horrors that were directed at the Jewish people. We must continually guard our heart against the same kind of apathy that is all around us.

                The Hanukkah story begins with the rise to power of Alexander the Great several centuries before Yeshua (Jesus) was born. At the time, the world was unified into one common government and culture called "Hellenism". After Alexander died at an early age, his kingdom was divided into four different provinces. The Israelites lived in the province of Syria under the leadership of a "mad tyrant" named Antiochus Epiphanes.

            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">

                Finally, one brave family from a little town called Modi'in, led a rebellion against Antiochus and his Syrian army. The rebellion ws originally led by an old Jewish priest named Mattihias, who killed a fellow Jew, whom he caught sacrificing a pig. After also killing several Greek soldiers, Mattithias and his five sons fled to the hills and began a "guerilla warfare" campaign against the Syrian army. Before he died, Mattithias passed the leadership to one of his sons, Judah the Maccabee, whose name means "the hammer".

                Though facing unbelievable odds, being totally outnumbered by the enemy, Judah and his men won a total victory over Antiochus and his entire army.

                An eight day celebration began as the Temple lamp stand was illuminated. However, there was only enough oil to keep the lamp stand burning for one day but God performed a miracle and kept the lamps burning for eight full days so the Israelites could fully celebrate the victory that God gave them. For this reason, Hanukkah is also known as the "Season of Miracles".

                The Hanukkah story itself is found in the two books of the Maccabees, which are part of the Apocrypha. The fourteen books of the Apocrypha are not included in the canonized bibles of Judaism and Christianity; however, they are included in the Septuagint, which is the Greek translation of the books written by Jewish scholars for the Greek speaking Jewish people. The Septuagint was originally compiled about 250 years before the birth of the Messiah, with the books of the Maccabees being added approximately in the year 100 BC.

                However, there is an accounting of Hanukkah in the canonized book of the prophet Daniel in Daniel, chapters 8 and 11 and also in the Brit Hadashah (New Covenant) in the gospel of John, chapter 10 where we see Yeshua (Jesus) himself attending the Feast of Dedication, which is Hanukkah.

Antiochus is also a type of the Anti-Christ who will be revealed in the last days, which we are certainly in. He, too, will desecrate the Temple (Daniel 9:27 and 12:11) which says "He shall bring an end to the daily sacrifice and offering and on the wing of abominations shall be one who makes desolate". (I suggest you read Daniel, chapters 8-12 for more insight on this entire matter.)

By no coincidence, He speaks about the "miraculous" good works that He does in His Father's Name and He plainly reveals Himself to the Pharisees as the Messiah and the Son of God.

                By virtue of the fact, that Yeshua himself attended the Feast of Hannukah, we too as believers in Him (Jew or Gentile) should observe the Feast of Hanukkah also.

                Add to this, the fact that Hanukkah is also known as "The Festival of Lights". Due to the miraculous "illumination" of the Temple lamp stand for 8 full days, even though there was only a one day supply of oil. In John 8:12 Yeshua said, "I am the light of the world, he who believes in Me shall not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life." In Matthew 5:14-16 He also told us that "we too are the light of the world" and that we must "let our lights shine before men that they may see the good deeds and glorify our Father in heaven."

                The lighting of the Hanukkah menorah (also called a "Hanukkiah") during the eight days of Hanukkah is not only rich in Jewish tradition but has great Messianic insights as well. The Hanukkah menorah is a nine branched menorah, different than the seven branched menorah or "lamp stand" that was in the Holy Place in the Tabernacle of Moses and in the Temple of One of the branches is reserved for what is called in Hebrew the "Shamash" candle (Shamash candles, adding an extra candle each evening as the festival progresses until all the candles are lit on the eighth night of Hanukkah.

                The Shamash or the "servant" candle is, of course, symbolic of Yeshua. Not only is He the "light of the world" that has "illuminated" all of us with the glory of God but He is also the "servant" of God, for He said to us in Mark 10:45 "for even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but "to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many".

            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                Like Yeshua, we too are called to be servants of the Most High to bring the "light of God" to a dark world and to be "servants" to mankind by demonstrating good deeds which brings glory to our Father in heaven. This is expressed by the love of God which has been shed abroad in our hearts through the power of the Ruach Ha Kodesh, the Holy Spirit! Freely we have received, freely we must give!

                Hanukkah, which generally falls around the same time of the year as Christmas is called "Festival of Lights" because of the "miracle of the oil" which took place enabling the Temple lamp stand to burn brightly for eight full days, instead of only one. Therefore, the theme of "light" and "miracles" are connected here between Hanukkah and Christmas.

                However a more important connection that we should consider is this. If Antiochus Epiphanes, the villain of the Hanukkah story, would have succeeded in exterminating the Jewish people altogether in the middle of the 2nd Century BC, the Jewish Messiah and Savior of the world never would have been born. In other words, without Hanukkah, there would be no Christmas. Hanukkah had to come first so that the Son of God might be born. For this we must eternally be grateful not only to God, but to a small band of brave Jewish men known as the "Maccabees" who defeated Antiochus and his army. before they could destroy the Jewish people.

                Now, we have seen that the Hebrew word Hanukkah means "dedication," commemorating the cleansing and "re-dedication" of the Temple by the Maccabees after it had been polluted and defiled by Israel's enemies.

            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                The theme of "dedication" and "God's Temple" is very important to us as believers in Yeshua. In John 2:19, Yeshua said "Destroy this temple and I will build it again in three days," speaking of His body which was resurrected after three days of being in the ground. As believers in Him, we are His body. In 1t Corinthians 3:16, Paul said, "Don't you know that you yourselves are God's Temple, and that God's Spirit lives in you". If anyone defiles the temple, God will destroy him! In your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit... therefore honor God with your body" and again in Ephesians 2:21, Paul says, "in Him (Yeshua), the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple to the Lord, and in Him (Yeshua) you too are being built together as a dwelling place where God lives by His spirit."

                For us as believers, wether Jew or Gentile, the Feast of Hanukkah represents the dedication and re-dedication of our lives and our physical bodies to the God of Israel. By analogy, it all comes back to two men in the Hanukkah story. Mattithias, a faithful Jewish priest who would not compromise when it came to keeping God's Temple holy and led a rebellion against those who desecrated it and a fellow Jew, who under the influence of a "worldly spirit" sacrificed "pigs" on an unholy altar. Both had the same covenant promises but one refused to defile God's Temple while the other did!

            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                The Year of Jubilee is celebrated once every 50 years, throughout all the land of Israel (Leviticus 25:8-13).
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                In the Year of Jubilee (Leviticus 25), every man was free to return to the original property given to him and his family under the leadership of Joshua after the conquest of Canaan, the Promised Land. Even if he previously sold it to another Israelite or even if he and his family were working as "hired hands" on another Israelites property, he was now free to return home.

                <b>All Debts Completely Cancelled</b>
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                Also in the Year of Jubilee, all debts were completely cancelled, no matter what you owed someone. All mortgage lease, rental and labor agreements were completely terminated. All personal debts were completely wiped out. ( And as we like to say in Judaism, "Such a deal!")
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                 The Year of Jubilee had a "leveling effect" on all of the Israelite community. It gave everyone a chance to "start over"; everybody's slate was "wiped clean" just as it is for us, when we accept the Messiah Jesus into our lives. 2nd Corinthians 5:17 says, "If any man is in the Messiah, he is a new creature. The old has gone, the new has come. Right away, we can see how the Year of Jubilee pointed toward Yeshua.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                <b>Blast of the Ram's Horn</b>
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                The Year of Jubilee was also ushered in with the blast of the ram's horn (shofar, in Hebrew) to proclaim liberty throughout all the land, proclaiming freedom and "release" from the Lord. In addition, the shofar blast announcing the Year of Jubilee was sounded on the 10th day of the 7th month, which is the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur in Hebrew), a day in biblical Judaism when "sins are forgiven". There are further Messianic implication here.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                <b>Our Debts Cancelled Through Blood Yeshua Shed for Us</b>
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                Imagine the joy that came over the land when that shofar was sounded, freedom from dept, freedom from slavery, free to go home. ALl of these things point toward Yeshua. Our "debts" have been cancelled through the blood that He shed on the tree of sacrifice for all sinners. We are no longer slaves to Satan, sin or death and when the Son of God sets you free, "you are free indeed" and now through Yeshua, we are all free to go to our "promised homeland", the Kingdom of Heaven.

                <b>Isaiah 61</b>
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                To further understand the Year of Jubilee in a biblical Jewish context, we must read from the prophet Isaiah in chapter 61:1 & 2 which says, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to heal the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to those who are bound, to proclaim tbe acceptable year of the Lord".
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                In the gospel of Luke, chapter 4:16-21 it says that Yeshua came to Nazareth where He had been brought up and that as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath as was His regular custom. In other words, Yeshua attended Shabbat services on a regular basis. He still does!
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                He was handed the book of the prophet Isaiah and He began to read: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to heal the broken hearted, to proclaim  liberty to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord."
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                As everyone's eyes were fixed upon Him, He went on to say: "Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing."
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                In Matthew 5:17 Yeshua said, "do not think I've come to abolish the Law or the Prophets, I have come to fulfill them.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                In Luke 24:44 Yeshua said, "everything written the Law of Moses and in the Prophets... testifies of me."
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                Through the Laws of Moses (Leviticus 25), God commanded the Israelites to keep the Year of Jubilee.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                Through the Prophet Isaiah (Chapter 61:1-2) God prophesied that there would be a future fulfillment to the Year of Jubilee.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                In the gospel of Luke, chapter 4, we see that this all pointed to Yeshua.
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                He is our "Jubilee" and our salvation. Blessed is the man who puts his trust in Him!
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                <b>The Shofar</b>
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                By definition, the shofar is a curved horn or a trumpet made from a ram's horn. It is different than a trumpet itself, which is called, in Hebrew, "cha-totz-rah".
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                According to the Scriptures, the shofar is used for many different purposes. It is used to proclaim the biblical feasts of the Lord (Numbers 10:10 and Psalm 81:3-4)
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                It is used in praising the Lord (Psalm 98:4-6).
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                It is used in spiritual warfare (Joshua 6:2-5) where we see that the blast of the shofar was very instrumental in bringing down the walls of the enemy. In other words, the sound of the shofar is an audible sound that you can hear with the natural ear, but it also causes things to happen in the spiritual realm that the natural ear cannot hear, namely the tearing down of the walls of the enemy!
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                Paul says in 2nd Corinthians 10:4 "that the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through good even to the pulling down of strongholds"
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                As a special note of interest, when the Israelites won the Six Day War in 1967, the shofar was constantly being sounded by the Israelites as the enemy was defeated and as Jerusalem was being restored to the Jewish people!
            </h5>
            <h5 class="w3-left w3-margin-left w3-col  " style="font-family: Bree Serif, serif">
                As we have already seen, the shofar was sounded to proclaim the year of Jubilee and according to 1st Thessalonians 4:16-17, when we hear the blast of the heavenly shofar, we will see Yeshua coming on the clouds of glory to claim His bride.
