                <p class=""> The Tabernacle is an outreach of Tabernacle of Praise Ministries, which was founded at Eureka Springs, Arkansas, during the Autumn of 2000, by Messianic Rabbi Jeremy Storch. The ministry has two primary goals: bring Jewish people to Yeshua the Messiah, and teach church congregations about the Hebrew roots of Christianity.

                    The Tabernacle is the Messianic Jewish congregation in Branson, Missouri. In addition, Rabbi Storch actively seeks opportunities to minister in other churches and synagogues whenever possible.

                    Rabbi Storch is of Jewish descent, a cantor, praise and worship leader, musician, composer, and well-known recording artist. He specializes in leading joyous Davidic praise and worship as described in First Chronicles. He has recorded a number of popular Messianic albums that have circulated internationally. Some of his songs have been translated into other languages are are being sung in Messianic congregations in other nations.

                    In addition to his evangelistic outreach, his music, and his local congregations, Rabbi Storch currently is conducting classes for selected students, discipling them for various roles in Messianic Jewish ministry.

                    Although Tabernacle of Praise Ministries is relatively young, it is enjoying healthy growth, and has inspired the rise of other Messianic congregations in nearby towns and encouraged revival in a number of local churches.

                    The central theme of Tabernacle of Praise Ministries is unity--bringing together Jew and Gentile on the common ground of the Bible and Yeshua, the Hebrew name for Jesus. This theme is inspired by the Lord's own prayer to the Father, in John 17:21.

                    "... that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they also may be one in Us..." (NKJV)

        <p class="w3-col m8" style ="font-family:Bree Serif">Jeremy Storch was born in New York City and raised in the Jewish heritage. Following high school, Jeremy co-founded the very successful rock group called "The Vagrants."  Jeremy was the songwriter, organist and vocalist for the group.

            Once "The Vagrants" disbanded, in 1968, RCA Records picked up Jeremy to record and release two solo albums, "From a Naked Window" and "Forty Miles Past Woodstock.." This popularity and success led him further into the rock culture of the sixties - including all the trappings of a typical rock star: experimentation with and heavy use of various drugs and plunging into wild parties and illicit affairs. In short, he became a prodigal son.

            In 1970, Jeremy's excessive lifestyle caught up with him and he died of a drug overdose on the way to the hospital. In this death experience, God spoke to Jeremy saying, "I am giving you back your life to do some work for Me!" As soon as that was spoken, Jeremy awoke in a hospital bed.

            Several years passed before Jeremy obeyed the voice he heard that evening. He continued in the secular music field with Dave Mason, who recorded Jeremy's song, "Spend Your Life With Me," and Eddie Money, who also recorded one of Jeremy's songs, "Call On Me."

            In 1978, Jeremy found himself in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, with a role in the Passion Play that was presented annually by the city. He played one of the two thieves on the cross. After hanging on the cross in front of 4,000 people for two nights, the Holy Spirit started working in Jeremy's heart.

            After the evening performance, Jeremy retreated to a cabin in the woods and he broke down and cried, realizing his sinfulness. In the middle of that night he awoke and heard the same voice he had witnessed seven years earlier, this time saying: "My son, your sins are forgiven, but go and sin no more, for I have a brand new life for you." At that moment, Jeremy totally dedicated his life to the Lord Yeshua (Jesus).

            Jeremy is an ordained Messianic Rabbi and Cantor who served for nine years at Temple Aron Ha Kodesh in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, one of the largest Messianic synagogues in the world. He also has led worship in many Messianic synagogues, churches and worship conferences and has helped to build up praise and worship programs throughout the body of Yeshua. He has also recorded, arranged and produced several albums: "Let Every Knee", "Hebrew Lord", "I believe in Yeshua", "Praise Your Name", "Behold the Bridegroom", "In Heavenly Places," "He Reigns," "On Mount Zion" and "In
            the Presence of the Lord."  His newest album is "All Rise," which features 14 original songs.  In addition, he ministers in other congregations by giving musical concerts, leading praise and worship, teaching on the Biblical Jewish roots of Christianity, and sharing his dynamic testimony.

            Jeremy has made several national television appearances, including "The New Jim Bakker Show," "Keeping in Truth,"  "Praise the Lord," "Jewish Jewels," and "Jewish Voice" broadcasts. He has performed at many Messianic conferences around the country and is a regular guest at KLFC Life FM Radio in Branson, Missouri.

            The international ministry "Jews for Jesus" has published for worldwide distribution a Messianic Hymnal with many of Jeremy's songs in it. These songs and many others that he has written are now being used for praise and worship in congregations all around the world, especially in the U.S., Israel, Europe and Latin America.

            Jeremy is the Rabbi and worship leader of The Tabernacle, a rapidly growing Messianic Jewish congregation meeting Friday evenings for Torah Study and Saturday mornings for worship in Branson, Missouri.

                Our worship includes joyous music and dance introduced by King David at the height of Israel’s glory - worship that was embraced by the Lord (1&2 Samuel and 1&2 Chronicles) – and continued in the first Messianic Jewish fellowship described in the Book of Acts, as affirmed by the Apostle James in Acts 15:16-17.  We are a restoration of that fellowship.

                Our congregation takes an active part in the various aspects of Davidic Praise and Worship.  We offer classes to teach those who want to learn more and participate.

                We believe in one true God: the Creator of heaven and earth, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
                (Exodus 3:6)

                We believe in the triune nature of God, and though He is One God, we believe that He manifests Himself as God the Father (Avinu), God the Son (Yeshua), and God the Holy Spirit (Ruach Ha Kodesh).
                (2 Corinthians 13:14)

                We believe that God the Father sent His only begotten Son, Yeshua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Messiah) to die on the tree of sacrifice to make atonement for the sins of all mankind.
                (John 3:16)

                We believe that following His crucifixion and death, God raised Yeshua (Jesus) from the dead; that He ascended back unto His Father in Heaven, where He reigns forever as King of kings and Lord of lords.
                (1 Corinthians. 15:20, Revelation 19:16)

                We believe that all who receive salvation through the blood atonement of Yeshua (Jesus) will also share in the power of His resurrection from the dead, and will live forever in the Kingdom of Heaven.
                (Revelation 5:9-10)

                We believe that the Ruach Ha Kodesh (Holy Spirit) has been poured out on all believers in Messiah Yeshua (Jesus) to empower them to be witnesses for Him, and to live a holy life in Him. We further believe in the nine-fold gifts of the Holy Spirit and in the operation of those gifts throughout the body of the Messiah.
                (Acts 1:8, 1 Corinthians 12:1-11)

                We believe that Yeshua (Jesus) has broken down the middle wall of partition, and that all believers, both Jew and Gentile are one in Him. We further believe that in these last days, God is preparing the Bride of Messiah for Yeshua's second coming, of which only the Father knows the timing.

                Many of our Jewish people believe that the New Covenant is only for the Gentiles, and the writings of the New Testament are only for Christians, not Jews. However, in the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) God clearly said He would establish a New Covenant with the Jewish people.

                "Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah--"not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, though I was a husband to them, says the Lord. But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put My law in their minds, and write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people. No more shall every man teach his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' for they all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says the Lord. For I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more."
                (Jer. 31:31-34)

                This New Covenant was instituted by the Messiah Himself, shortly before His crucifixion, when at the Passover table He took the cup and said, "drink from it, all of you - this is the blood of the covenant which is poured out for many, for the forgiveness of sins"
                (Matt. 26:27-28).

                That cup represented the blood atonement He would make for the sins of all mankind.

                The theme of "the shedding of blood" is dominant through out the Torah. The blood of the Passover Lamb was applied to the door posts of every Israelite home just prior to the exodus from Egypt. When God saw the blood on the door-post, he "passed over" that house and those inside passed from death to life.

                The writings of Torah often reminds us the "without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins." "For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar, it is the blood that makes atonement for one's life." (Lev. 17:11)

                In the Tabernacle of Moses and in the Temple of Solomon, the blood of animals were offered as a sacrifice for the sins of the people (Particularly on Yom Kippur).

                All of these blood sacrifices foreshadowed the one perfect sacrifice that Yeshua made for the sins of all mankind. He is also known as the Lamb of God. If you apply (spiritually speaking) the blood of His atonement to the door-post of your heart, you will pass from "death unto life." You will also receive the gift of the Holy spirit. If you reject His blood sacrifice, which He made on your behalf, then there is no forgiveness of sins. Through Him is God's plan of salvation for the Jewish people
                and for all mankind.

                The Rabbis teach that when the Temple was destroyed in 70 AD by the Romans that blood atonement became unnecessary and that forgiveness of sins would now come through doing "good works". But God says, "without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins." Even the prophet Isaiah said, "our own acts of righteousness are like filthy rags before the Lord."

                The question to all of us is "do you think you can save yourself" or "Do you want to come under the covenant which God has provided for you through the Blood of the Messiah?"

                The Jewish ritual of Mikvah goes back to the time when God brought the children of Israel through the waters of the Red Sea, as He delivered them from Pharaoh and his host. This took place immediately after the first Passover, when the blood of the lamb was applied to the door post of every Israelite home.

                As God led them though the water, Israel as a nation, became baptized unto a whole new way of life. God not only delivered them from a former life of oppression, slavery and bondage, but He also established them as a holy nation, as He let them toward the promised land.

                As believers in the Messiah Yeshua, God has done the same for us through the blood of His Son, the Lamb of God who died for our sins on Passover. We have been set free from a former life of bondage, slavery and sin. We observe the ceremony of Mikvah as being baptized unto a whole new way of life in the Messiah, to be a holy nation as God leads us toward the Kingdom of heaven.

                Romans 6:3&4 says: "Don't you know that all of us who were baptized into the Messiah Yeshua were baptized into His death? We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death in order that just as Messiah was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life."

                The following blessings may be used at a Messianic Jewish Mikvah service:

                Baruch atah adonai elohayne melech ha'olam asher kid'shanu b'mitzvotav v'tzivanu al hatvilah. "Deserving of praise are you, O Lord our God, Ruler of the universe who set us apart by His commandments and commanded us concerning the immersion."

                Ah-nee mat'beel ot'cha b'shem Ha-Av, v'Yeshua, v'Ruach Ha Kodesh. "I immerse you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit."

                The Trinity is a great stumbling block for our Jewish people in accepting Yeshua as Messiah, because according to the unsaved Jewish mindset, to accept Yeshua is to also embrace the Christian theology which says there are three gods. This kind of thinking would be totally contrary to the "Shema" which says in Deut. 6:4 "Shema Yisrael, Adonai Eloheynu Adonai Echod" which translates in English, "Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One." The truth is the Lord our God is one God, who manifests His presence in 3 Divine Persons: Avinu (Our Father), Yeshua (The Son), Ruach Ha Kodesh (Holy Spirit).

                So how can three be One? This is a hard concept for the human mind to grasp. However, God created and arranged many things in a triune fashion:

                (a) The universe consists of space, time and matter.
                (b) Space consists of length, breadth and depth.
                (c) Time consists of past, present and future.

                However, even basic Judaism teaches the same concept:

                (a) The patriarchs are three - Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
                (b) The Tenach (Hebrew Bible) is made up of - the Torah, the Prophets and the Writings.
                (c) The 3 pieces of Matzah at the Passover table represent - the Priests, the Levites, the People (of course the 3 pieces represent the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit).

                The Trinity is not originally a Christian concept. It was well documented in the Hebrew scriptures long before the New Testament was written. The scriptures references often read "Elohim" in the Tenach (the plural form of God"). The following scriptures from the Tenach all use "Elohim":

                (a) Gen. 1:1-2; 26: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. Then God said, 'Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."
                (b) Gen. 3:22: "Then the Lord God said, 'Behold, the man has become like one of Us , to know good and evil. And now, lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever"
                (c) Psalm 110:1: "The Lord said to my Lord , 'Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your footstool."
                (d) Prov. 30:4: "Who has ascended into heaven¸ or descended? Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has bound the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is His name, and what is His Son's name, if you know?"
                (e) Isa. 48:16 (A great Messianic Prophecy says - " The sovereign Lord (God) has sent me (The Messiah) with His Spirit (The Holy Spirit)".

                There are many other passages in the Tenach (O.T.) which clearly reflect the triune nature of God.

                The Trinity, contrary to popular belief, finds it's roots in Judaism, not Christianity. In either case, the Trinity does not represent 3 gods, but one God who manifests Himself in 3 Divine Persons - This may be hard for the human mind to grasp, but with God all things are possible!

                <p class=""> The Tabernacle is an outreach of Tabernacle of Praise Ministries, which was founded at Eureka Springs, Arkansas, during the Autumn of 2000, by Messianic Rabbi Jeremy Storch. The ministry has two primary goals: bring Jewish people to Yeshua the Messiah, and teach church congregations about the Hebrew roots of Christianity.

                    The Tabernacle is the Messianic Jewish congregation in Branson, Missouri. In addition, Rabbi Storch actively seeks opportunities to minister in other churches and synagogues whenever possible.

                    Rabbi Storch is of Jewish descent, a cantor, praise and worship leader, musician, composer, and well-known recording artist. He specializes in leading joyous Davidic praise and worship as described in First Chronicles. He has recorded a number of popular Messianic albums that have circulated internationally. Some of his songs have been translated into other languages are are being sung in Messianic congregations in other nations.

                    In addition to his evangelistic outreach, his music, and his local congregations, Rabbi Storch currently is conducting classes for selected students, discipling them for various roles in Messianic Jewish ministry.

                    Although Tabernacle of Praise Ministries is relatively young, it is enjoying healthy growth, and has inspired the rise of other Messianic congregations in nearby towns and encouraged revival in a number of local churches.

                    The central theme of Tabernacle of Praise Ministries is unity--bringing together Jew and Gentile on the common ground of the Bible and Yeshua, the Hebrew name for Jesus. This theme is inspired by the Lord's own prayer to the Father, in John 17:21.

                    "... that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they also may be one in Us..." (NKJV)

            <p class="w3-col m8" style ="font-family:Bree Serif">Jeremy Storch was born in New York City and raised in the Jewish heritage. Following high school, Jeremy co-founded the very successful rock group called "The Vagrants."  Jeremy was the songwriter, organist and vocalist for the group.

                Once "The Vagrants" disbanded, in 1968, RCA Records picked up Jeremy to record and release two solo albums, "From a Naked Window" and "Forty Miles Past Woodstock.." This popularity and success led him further into the rock culture of the sixties - including all the trappings of a typical rock star: experimentation with and heavy use of various drugs and plunging into wild parties and illicit affairs. In short, he became a prodigal son.

                In 1970, Jeremy's excessive lifestyle caught up with him and he died of a drug overdose on the way to the hospital. In this death experience, God spoke to Jeremy saying, "I am giving you back your life to do some work for Me!" As soon as that was spoken, Jeremy awoke in a hospital bed.

                Several years passed before Jeremy obeyed the voice he heard that evening. He continued in the secular music field with Dave Mason, who recorded Jeremy's song, "Spend Your Life With Me," and Eddie Money, who also recorded one of Jeremy's songs, "Call On Me."

                In 1978, Jeremy found himself in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, with a role in the Passion Play that was presented annually by the city. He played one of the two thieves on the cross. After hanging on the cross in front of 4,000 people for two nights, the Holy Spirit started working in Jeremy's heart.

                After the evening performance, Jeremy retreated to a cabin in the woods and he broke down and cried, realizing his sinfulness. In the middle of that night he awoke and heard the same voice he had witnessed seven years earlier, this time saying: "My son, your sins are forgiven, but go and sin no more, for I have a brand new life for you." At that moment, Jeremy totally dedicated his life to the Lord Yeshua (Jesus).

                Jeremy is an ordained Messianic Rabbi and Cantor who served for nine years at Temple Aron Ha Kodesh in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, one of the largest Messianic synagogues in the world. He also has led worship in many Messianic synagogues, churches and worship conferences and has helped to build up praise and worship programs throughout the body of Yeshua. He has also recorded, arranged and produced several albums: "Let Every Knee", "Hebrew Lord", "I believe in Yeshua", "Praise Your Name", "Behold the Bridegroom", "In Heavenly Places," "He Reigns," "On Mount Zion" and "In
                the Presence of the Lord."  His newest album is "All Rise," which features 14 original songs.  In addition, he ministers in other congregations by giving musical concerts, leading praise and worship, teaching on the Biblical Jewish roots of Christianity, and sharing his dynamic testimony.

                Jeremy has made several national television appearances, including "The New Jim Bakker Show," "Keeping in Truth,"  "Praise the Lord," "Jewish Jewels," and "Jewish Voice" broadcasts. He has performed at many Messianic conferences around the country and is a regular guest at KLFC Life FM Radio in Branson, Missouri.

                The international ministry "Jews for Jesus" has published for worldwide distribution a Messianic Hymnal with many of Jeremy's songs in it. These songs and many others that he has written are now being used for praise and worship in congregations all around the world, especially in the U.S., Israel, Europe and Latin America.

                Jeremy is the Rabbi and worship leader of The Tabernacle, a rapidly growing Messianic Jewish congregation meeting Friday evenings for Torah Study and Saturday mornings for worship in Branson, Missouri.

                Our worship includes joyous music and dance introduced by King David at the height of Israel’s glory - worship that was embraced by the Lord (1&2 Samuel and 1&2 Chronicles) – and continued in the first Messianic Jewish fellowship described in the Book of Acts, as affirmed by the Apostle James in Acts 15:16-17.  We are a restoration of that fellowship.

                Our congregation takes an active part in the various aspects of Davidic Praise and Worship.  We offer classes to teach those who want to learn more and participate.

                We believe in one true God: the Creator of heaven and earth, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
                (Exodus 3:6)

                We believe in the triune nature of God, and though He is One God, we believe that He manifests Himself as God the Father (Avinu), God the Son (Yeshua), and God the Holy Spirit (Ruach Ha Kodesh).
                (2 Corinthians 13:14)

                We believe that God the Father sent His only begotten Son, Yeshua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Messiah) to die on the tree of sacrifice to make atonement for the sins of all mankind.
                (John 3:16)

                We believe that following His crucifixion and death, God raised Yeshua (Jesus) from the dead; that He ascended back unto His Father in Heaven, where He reigns forever as King of kings and Lord of lords.
                (1 Corinthians. 15:20, Revelation 19:16)

                We believe that all who receive salvation through the blood atonement of Yeshua (Jesus) will also share in the power of His resurrection from the dead, and will live forever in the Kingdom of Heaven.
                (Revelation 5:9-10)

                We believe that the Ruach Ha Kodesh (Holy Spirit) has been poured out on all believers in Messiah Yeshua (Jesus) to empower them to be witnesses for Him, and to live a holy life in Him. We further believe in the nine-fold gifts of the Holy Spirit and in the operation of those gifts throughout the body of the Messiah.
                (Acts 1:8, 1 Corinthians 12:1-11)

                We believe that Yeshua (Jesus) has broken down the middle wall of partition, and that all believers, both Jew and Gentile are one in Him. We further believe that in these last days, God is preparing the Bride of Messiah for Yeshua's second coming, of which only the Father knows the timing.

                Many of our Jewish people believe that the New Covenant is only for the Gentiles, and the writings of the New Testament are only for Christians, not Jews. However, in the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) God clearly said He would establish a New Covenant with the Jewish people.

                "Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah--"not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, though I was a husband to them, says the Lord. But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put My law in their minds, and write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people. No more shall every man teach his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' for they all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says the Lord. For I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more."
                (Jer. 31:31-34)

                This New Covenant was instituted by the Messiah Himself, shortly before His crucifixion, when at the Passover table He took the cup and said, "drink from it, all of you - this is the blood of the covenant which is poured out for many, for the forgiveness of sins"
                (Matt. 26:27-28).

                That cup represented the blood atonement He would make for the sins of all mankind.

                The theme of "the shedding of blood" is dominant through out the Torah. The blood of the Passover Lamb was applied to the door posts of every Israelite home just prior to the exodus from Egypt. When God saw the blood on the door-post, he "passed over" that house and those inside passed from death to life.

                The writings of Torah often reminds us the "without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins." "For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar, it is the blood that makes atonement for one's life." (Lev. 17:11)

                In the Tabernacle of Moses and in the Temple of Solomon, the blood of animals were offered as a sacrifice for the sins of the people (Particularly on Yom Kippur).

                All of these blood sacrifices foreshadowed the one perfect sacrifice that Yeshua made for the sins of all mankind. He is also known as the Lamb of God. If you apply (spiritually speaking) the blood of His atonement to the door-post of your heart, you will pass from "death unto life." You will also receive the gift of the Holy spirit. If you reject His blood sacrifice, which He made on your behalf, then there is no forgiveness of sins. Through Him is God's plan of salvation for the Jewish people
                and for all mankind.

                The Rabbis teach that when the Temple was destroyed in 70 AD by the Romans that blood atonement became unnecessary and that forgiveness of sins would now come through doing "good works". But God says, "without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins." Even the prophet Isaiah said, "our own acts of righteousness are like filthy rags before the Lord."

                The question to all of us is "do you think you can save yourself" or "Do you want to come under the covenant which God has provided for you through the Blood of the Messiah?"

                The Jewish ritual of Mikvah goes back to the time when God brought the children of Israel through the waters of the Red Sea, as He delivered them from Pharaoh and his host. This took place immediately after the first Passover, when the blood of the lamb was applied to the door post of every Israelite home.

                As God led them though the water, Israel as a nation, became baptized unto a whole new way of life. God not only delivered them from a former life of oppression, slavery and bondage, but He also established them as a holy nation, as He let them toward the promised land.

                As believers in the Messiah Yeshua, God has done the same for us through the blood of His Son, the Lamb of God who died for our sins on Passover. We have been set free from a former life of bondage, slavery and sin. We observe the ceremony of Mikvah as being baptized unto a whole new way of life in the Messiah, to be a holy nation as God leads us toward the Kingdom of heaven.

                Romans 6:3&4 says: "Don't you know that all of us who were baptized into the Messiah Yeshua were baptized into His death? We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death in order that just as Messiah was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life."

                The following blessings may be used at a Messianic Jewish Mikvah service:

                Baruch atah adonai elohayne melech ha'olam asher kid'shanu b'mitzvotav v'tzivanu al hatvilah. "Deserving of praise are you, O Lord our God, Ruler of the universe who set us apart by His commandments and commanded us concerning the immersion."

                Ah-nee mat'beel ot'cha b'shem Ha-Av, v'Yeshua, v'Ruach Ha Kodesh. "I immerse you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit."

                The Trinity is a great stumbling block for our Jewish people in accepting Yeshua as Messiah, because according to the unsaved Jewish mindset, to accept Yeshua is to also embrace the Christian theology which says there are three gods. This kind of thinking would be totally contrary to the "Shema" which says in Deut. 6:4 "Shema Yisrael, Adonai Eloheynu Adonai Echod" which translates in English, "Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One." The truth is the Lord our God is one God, who manifests His presence in 3 Divine Persons: Avinu (Our Father), Yeshua (The Son), Ruach Ha Kodesh (Holy Spirit).

                So how can three be One? This is a hard concept for the human mind to grasp. However, God created and arranged many things in a triune fashion:

                (a) The universe consists of space, time and matter.
                (b) Space consists of length, breadth and depth.
                (c) Time consists of past, present and future.

                However, even basic Judaism teaches the same concept:

                (a) The patriarchs are three - Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
                (b) The Tenach (Hebrew Bible) is made up of - the Torah, the Prophets and the Writings.
                (c) The 3 pieces of Matzah at the Passover table represent - the Priests, the Levites, the People (of course the 3 pieces represent the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit).

                The Trinity is not originally a Christian concept. It was well documented in the Hebrew scriptures long before the New Testament was written. The scriptures references often read "Elohim" in the Tenach (the plural form of God"). The following scriptures from the Tenach all use "Elohim":

                (a) Gen. 1:1-2; 26: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. Then God said, 'Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."
                (b) Gen. 3:22: "Then the Lord God said, 'Behold, the man has become like one of Us , to know good and evil. And now, lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever"
                (c) Psalm 110:1: "The Lord said to my Lord , 'Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your footstool."
                (d) Prov. 30:4: "Who has ascended into heaven¸ or descended? Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has bound the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is His name, and what is His Son's name, if you know?"
                (e) Isa. 48:16 (A great Messianic Prophecy says - " The sovereign Lord (God) has sent me (The Messiah) with His Spirit (The Holy Spirit)".

                There are many other passages in the Tenach (O.T.) which clearly reflect the triune nature of God.

                The Trinity, contrary to popular belief, finds it's roots in Judaism, not Christianity. In either case, the Trinity does not represent 3 gods, but one God who manifests Himself in 3 Divine Persons - This may be hard for the human mind to grasp, but with God all things are possible!

            <p class=""> The Tabernacle is an outreach of Tabernacle of Praise Ministries, which was founded at Eureka Springs, Arkansas, during the Autumn of 2000, by Messianic Rabbi Jeremy Storch. The ministry has two primary goals: bring Jewish people to Yeshua the Messiah, and teach church congregations about the Hebrew roots of Christianity.

                The Tabernacle is the Messianic Jewish congregation in Branson, Missouri. In addition, Rabbi Storch actively seeks opportunities to minister in other churches and synagogues whenever possible.

                Rabbi Storch is of Jewish descent, a cantor, praise and worship leader, musician, composer, and well-known recording artist. He specializes in leading joyous Davidic praise and worship as described in First Chronicles. He has recorded a number of popular Messianic albums that have circulated internationally. Some of his songs have been translated into other languages are are being sung in Messianic congregations in other nations.

                In addition to his evangelistic outreach, his music, and his local congregations, Rabbi Storch currently is conducting classes for selected students, discipling them for various roles in Messianic Jewish ministry.

                Although Tabernacle of Praise Ministries is relatively young, it is enjoying healthy growth, and has inspired the rise of other Messianic congregations in nearby towns and encouraged revival in a number of local churches.

                The central theme of Tabernacle of Praise Ministries is unity--bringing together Jew and Gentile on the common ground of the Bible and Yeshua, the Hebrew name for Jesus. This theme is inspired by the Lord's own prayer to the Father, in John 17:21.

                "... that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they also may be one in Us..." (NKJV)

        <p class="w3-col m8" style ="font-family:Bree Serif">Jeremy Storch was born in New York City and raised in the Jewish heritage. Following high school, Jeremy co-founded the very successful rock group called "The Vagrants."  Jeremy was the songwriter, organist and vocalist for the group.

            Once "The Vagrants" disbanded, in 1968, RCA Records picked up Jeremy to record and release two solo albums, "From a Naked Window" and "Forty Miles Past Woodstock.." This popularity and success led him further into the rock culture of the sixties - including all the trappings of a typical rock star: experimentation with and heavy use of various drugs and plunging into wild parties and illicit affairs. In short, he became a prodigal son.

            In 1970, Jeremy's excessive lifestyle caught up with him and he died of a drug overdose on the way to the hospital. In this death experience, God spoke to Jeremy saying, "I am giving you back your life to do some work for Me!" As soon as that was spoken, Jeremy awoke in a hospital bed.

            Several years passed before Jeremy obeyed the voice he heard that evening. He continued in the secular music field with Dave Mason, who recorded Jeremy's song, "Spend Your Life With Me," and Eddie Money, who also recorded one of Jeremy's songs, "Call On Me."

            In 1978, Jeremy found himself in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, with a role in the Passion Play that was presented annually by the city. He played one of the two thieves on the cross. After hanging on the cross in front of 4,000 people for two nights, the Holy Spirit started working in Jeremy's heart.

            After the evening performance, Jeremy retreated to a cabin in the woods and he broke down and cried, realizing his sinfulness. In the middle of that night he awoke and heard the same voice he had witnessed seven years earlier, this time saying: "My son, your sins are forgiven, but go and sin no more, for I have a brand new life for you." At that moment, Jeremy totally dedicated his life to the Lord Yeshua (Jesus).

            Jeremy is an ordained Messianic Rabbi and Cantor who served for nine years at Temple Aron Ha Kodesh in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, one of the largest Messianic synagogues in the world. He also has led worship in many Messianic synagogues, churches and worship conferences and has helped to build up praise and worship programs throughout the body of Yeshua. He has also recorded, arranged and produced several albums: "Let Every Knee", "Hebrew Lord", "I believe in Yeshua", "Praise Your Name", "Behold the Bridegroom", "In Heavenly Places," "He Reigns," "On Mount Zion" and "In
            the Presence of the Lord."  His newest album is "All Rise," which features 14 original songs.  In addition, he ministers in other congregations by giving musical concerts, leading praise and worship, teaching on the Biblical Jewish roots of Christianity, and sharing his dynamic testimony.

            Jeremy has made several national television appearances, including "The New Jim Bakker Show," "Keeping in Truth,"  "Praise the Lord," "Jewish Jewels," and "Jewish Voice" broadcasts. He has performed at many Messianic conferences around the country and is a regular guest at KLFC Life FM Radio in Branson, Missouri.

            The international ministry "Jews for Jesus" has published for worldwide distribution a Messianic Hymnal with many of Jeremy's songs in it. These songs and many others that he has written are now being used for praise and worship in congregations all around the world, especially in the U.S., Israel, Europe and Latin America.

            Jeremy is the Rabbi and worship leader of The Tabernacle, a rapidly growing Messianic Jewish congregation meeting Friday evenings for Torah Study and Saturday mornings for worship in Branson, Missouri.

            We believe in one true God: the Creator of heaven and earth, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
            (Exodus 3:6)

            We believe in the triune nature of God, and though He is One God, we believe that He manifests Himself as God the Father (Avinu), God the Son (Yeshua), and God the Holy Spirit (Ruach Ha Kodesh).
            (2 Corinthians 13:14)

            We believe that God the Father sent His only begotten Son, Yeshua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Messiah) to die on the tree of sacrifice to make atonement for the sins of all mankind.
            (John 3:16)

            We believe that following His crucifixion and death, God raised Yeshua (Jesus) from the dead; that He ascended back unto His Father in Heaven, where He reigns forever as King of kings and Lord of lords.
            (1 Corinthians. 15:20, Revelation 19:16)

            We believe that all who receive salvation through the blood atonement of Yeshua (Jesus) will also share in the power of His resurrection from the dead, and will live forever in the Kingdom of Heaven.
            (Revelation 5:9-10)

            We believe that the Ruach Ha Kodesh (Holy Spirit) has been poured out on all believers in Messiah Yeshua (Jesus) to empower them to be witnesses for Him, and to live a holy life in Him. We further believe in the nine-fold gifts of the Holy Spirit and in the operation of those gifts throughout the body of the Messiah.
            (Acts 1:8, 1 Corinthians 12:1-11)

            We believe that Yeshua (Jesus) has broken down the middle wall of partition, and that all believers, both Jew and Gentile are one in Him. We further believe that in these last days, God is preparing the Bride of Messiah for Yeshua's second coming, of which only the Father knows the timing.
            (Galatians 3:28, Matthew 24:36)

            Many of our Jewish people believe that the New Covenant is only for the Gentiles, and the writings of the New Testament are only for Christians, not Jews. However, in the Old Testament (Hebrew Bible) God clearly said He would establish a New Covenant with the Jewish people.

            "Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah--"not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, though I was a husband to them, says the Lord. But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put My law in their minds, and write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people. No more shall every man teach his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' for they all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says the Lord. For I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more."
            (Jer. 31:31-34)

            This New Covenant was instituted by the Messiah Himself, shortly before His crucifixion, when at the Passover table He took the cup and said, "drink from it, all of you - this is the blood of the covenant which is poured out for many, for the forgiveness of sins"
            (Matt. 26:27-28).

            That cup represented the blood atonement He would make for the sins of all mankind.

            The theme of "the shedding of blood" is dominant through out the Torah. The blood of the Passover Lamb was applied to the door posts of every Israelite home just prior to the exodus from Egypt. When God saw the blood on the door-post, he "passed over" that house and those inside passed from death to life.

            The writings of Torah often reminds us the "without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins." "For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar, it is the blood that makes atonement for one's life." (Lev. 17:11)

            In the Tabernacle of Moses and in the Temple of Solomon, the blood of animals were offered as a sacrifice for the sins of the people (Particularly on Yom Kippur).

            All of these blood sacrifices foreshadowed the one perfect sacrifice that Yeshua made for the sins of all mankind. He is also known as the Lamb of God. If you apply (spiritually speaking) the blood of His atonement to the door-post of your heart, you will pass from "death unto life." You will also receive the gift of the Holy spirit. If you reject His blood sacrifice, which He made on your behalf, then there is no forgiveness of sins. Through Him is God's plan of salvation for the Jewish people
            and for all mankind.

            The Rabbis teach that when the Temple was destroyed in 70 AD by the Romans that blood atonement became unnecessary and that forgiveness of sins would now come through doing "good works". But God says, "without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins." Even the prophet Isaiah said, "our own acts of righteousness are like filthy rags before the Lord."

            The question to all of us is "do you think you can save yourself" or "Do you want to come under the covenant which God has provided for you through the Blood of the Messiah?"

            The Jewish ritual of Mikvah goes back to the time when God brought the children of Israel through the waters of the Red Sea, as He delivered them from Pharaoh and his host. This took place immediately after the first Passover, when the blood of the lamb was applied to the door post of every Israelite home.

            As God led them though the water, Israel as a nation, became baptized unto a whole new way of life. God not only delivered them from a former life of oppression, slavery and bondage, but He also established them as a holy nation, as He let them toward the promised land.

            As believers in the Messiah Yeshua, God has done the same for us through the blood of His Son, the Lamb of God who died for our sins on Passover. We have been set free from a former life of bondage, slavery and sin. We observe the ceremony of Mikvah as being baptized unto a whole new way of life in the Messiah, to be a holy nation as God leads us toward the Kingdom of heaven.

            Romans 6:3&4 says: "Don't you know that all of us who were baptized into the Messiah Yeshua were baptized into His death? We were therefore buried with Him through baptism into death in order that just as Messiah was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life."

            The following blessings may be used at a Messianic Jewish Mikvah service:

            Baruch atah adonai elohayne melech ha'olam asher kid'shanu b'mitzvotav v'tzivanu al hatvilah. "Deserving of praise are you, O Lord our God, Ruler of the universe who set us apart by His commandments and commanded us concerning the immersion."

            Ah-nee mat'beel ot'cha b'shem Ha-Av, v'Yeshua, v'Ruach Ha Kodesh. "I immerse you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit."

            The Trinity is a great stumbling block for our Jewish people in accepting Yeshua as Messiah, because according to the unsaved Jewish mindset, to accept Yeshua is to also embrace the Christian theology which says there are three gods. This kind of thinking would be totally contrary to the "Shema" which says in Deut. 6:4 "Shema Yisrael, Adonai Eloheynu Adonai Echod" which translates in English, "Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One." The truth is the Lord our God is one God, who manifests His presence in 3 Divine Persons: Avinu (Our Father), Yeshua (The Son), Ruach Ha Kodesh (Holy Spirit).

            So how can three be One? This is a hard concept for the human mind to grasp. However, God created and arranged many things in a triune fashion:

            (a) The universe consists of space, time and matter.
            (b) Space consists of length, breadth and depth.
            (c) Time consists of past, present and future.

            However, even basic Judaism teaches the same concept:

            (a) The patriarchs are three - Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.
            (b) The Tenach (Hebrew Bible) is made up of - the Torah, the Prophets and the Writings.
            (c) The 3 pieces of Matzah at the Passover table represent - the Priests, the Levites, the People (of course the 3 pieces represent the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit).

            The Trinity is not originally a Christian concept. It was well documented in the Hebrew scriptures long before the New Testament was written. The scriptures references often read "Elohim" in the Tenach (the plural form of God"). The following scriptures from the Tenach all use "Elohim":

            (a) Gen. 1:1-2; 26: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. Then God said, 'Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."
            (b) Gen. 3:22: "Then the Lord God said, 'Behold, the man has become like one of Us , to know good and evil. And now, lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever"
            (c) Psalm 110:1: "The Lord said to my Lord , 'Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your footstool."
            (d) Prov. 30:4: "Who has ascended into heaven¸ or descended? Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has bound the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is His name, and what is His Son's name, if you know?"
            (e) Isa. 48:16 (A great Messianic Prophecy says - " The sovereign Lord (God) has sent me (The Messiah) with His Spirit (The Holy Spirit)".

            There are many other passages in the Tenach (O.T.) which clearly reflect the triune nature of God.

            The Trinity, contrary to popular belief, finds it's roots in Judaism, not Christianity. In either case, the Trinity does not represent 3 gods, but one God who manifests Himself in 3 Divine Persons - This may be hard for the human mind to grasp, but with God all things are possible!

            Our worship includes joyous music and dance introduced by King David at the height of Israel’s glory - worship that was embraced by the Lord (1&2 Samuel and 1&2 Chronicles) – and continued in the first Messianic Jewish fellowship described in the Book of Acts, as affirmed by the Apostle James in Acts 15:16-17.  We are a restoration of that fellowship.
